# Tertwit

This is the project of CSCI3100 Group D6 in the 2022-2023 2nd semester: Tertwit.

## Overview
Twitter performs as a social networking media platform. It provides a microblogging service that allows users to post ‘tweets’ containing texts, photos, emojis and links. Additionally, users can send instant messages to interact with their friends or even strangers. Twitter is designed for people to communicate and connect one another neglecting space, time and ethnicity.

## Key Features
Third-party Account Registration
For flexibility and simplicity, we allow users to register their accounts by email, Google account, GitHub account as well as Facebook account. For convenience, third-party users do not need to type password again if they have already logged in their accounts on the corresponding third-party platforms.

Administrator Accounts
There will be administrator accounts. They can view all user information, excluding passwords for privacy. Administrators shall remove users who have violated some rules, and add users if needed. A customized, separated authentication portal and a control dashboard will be set up for administrators for convenient management.

Private chat
Users can start private conversations with any users. Users can enable or disable this feature in user settings, users cannot send any messages to others who have disabled this feature.
