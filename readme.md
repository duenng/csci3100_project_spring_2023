# Tertwit

Tertwit is a social networking media platform designed to connect people from all around the world. It provides a microblogging service that allows users to post ‘tweets’ containing texts, photos, emojis, and links. Additionally, users can send instant messages to interact with their friends or even strangers. 

## Key Features

### Third-party Account Registration

For flexibility and simplicity, Tertwit allows users to register their accounts using email, Google, GitHub, and Facebook accounts. Users who have already logged in their accounts on the corresponding third-party platforms do not need to type their passwords again.

### Administrator Accounts

Tertwit has administrator accounts that can view all user information, excluding passwords for privacy. Administrators have the power to remove users who have violated rules, and add users if needed. A customized, separated authentication portal, and a control dashboard will be set up for administrators for convenient management.

### Private Chat

Tertwit allows users to start private conversations with any other user. Users can enable or disable this feature in user settings. Users cannot send any messages to others who have disabled this feature.
